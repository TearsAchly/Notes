# [Abstraction]()

**Abstraction** is the process of focusing on the most important and relevant parts of a problem, while ignoring unnecessary details. After a problem has been broken down through [**decomposition**](), abstraction helps identify which parts actually matter. The goal is to reduce complexity by keeping attention on what is essential and hiding what is not. Abstraction can also involve creating a simplified representation of a problem, making it easier to understand and solve.

# Why It Matters

* Focusing on irrelevant details makes problem-solving more complicated
* Abstraction helps reduce cognitive load and clarify thinking
* It allows solutions to be designed without being overwhelmed by complexity
* It highlights the core aspects of a problem while hiding unnecessary details

The purpose of abstraction is not to remove complexity entirely, but to **manage it** by emphasizing what truly matters.

# A Simple Example

Imagine you want to design a car that looks **good and visually appealing**.

In this case, you focus only on visual elements:

* The color of the car
* The shape of the body
* The wheels and the lights

You do **not** need to think about the engine, internal mechanics, or performance details.
Those aspects exist, but they are not relevant to the visual design problem.
