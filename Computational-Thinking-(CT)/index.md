# [Computational Thinking]()

**Computational Thinking (CT)** is a way of thinking that occurs when we **formulate a problem** and **design strategies** to choose solutions that are **effective, efficient, and optimal**.  
**Computational Thinking (CT)** can also be understood as the **ability to think systematically** by using **technology or computers as supporting tools**—although the thinking process itself does not always require a computer.

## How to Learn Computational Thinking?
**Computational thinking** can be learned and honed through practice, as well as through developing thought patterns based on experience. **Computational thinking** can also be learned by practicing solving computation-related problems, using everyday situations. Through engaging exercises, individuals apply appropriate techniques **decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, data representation, algorithmic** to find solutions. After practicing, individuals are expected to reflect and build their thinking knowledge, then develop increasingly sharp, fast, efficient, and optimal computational thinking patterns.

# Elements of Computational Thinking

1. [**Decomposition**]()
   Breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
   
2. [**Abstraction**]()
   Focusing on important information while ignoring unnecessary details.

3. [**Pattern Recognition**]()
   Identifying similarities or patterns from previous problems.

4. [**Algorithm**]()
   Creating clear, step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.

# Example

Imagine you get **bitten by mosquitoes**:

* If there is only one, you can simply slap it.
* If there are many, you might use an **electric mosquito racket**.
* But if you want to **sleep peacefully**, using **mosquito repellent** makes much more sense than staying awake all night 😄

The solution should **match the problem**.
You would not **burn down your house** just to get rid of mosquitoes—yes, the mosquitoes would be gone, but so would your house 😅

Without realizing it, you are:

* comparing possible solutions,
* choosing the most reasonable one,
* and considering efficiency and impact.

That is **Computational Thinking** in action.

# Conclusion

**Computational Thinking (CT)** is a **fundamental thinking process**.  
**Computational Thinking (CT)** is a **way of thinking toward solutions**.  
**Computational Thinking (CT)** is **conceptualization**, not programming.  
**Computational Thinking (CT)** can be applied in **all fields**.  

  * In **IT**, CT produces programmable solutions.
  * In **non-IT fields**, CT helps approach solutions when computation is needed.       
  
**Computational Thinking (CT)** is a form of **literacy** and **cannot be learned just by reading definitions**.  
**Computational Thinking (CT)** must be **practiced continuously**—reading and understanding concepts is not enough.
Only through regular practice can this way of thinking become a habit.
