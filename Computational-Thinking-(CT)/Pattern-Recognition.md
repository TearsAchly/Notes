# [Pattern Recognition]()

**Pattern Recognition** is the ability to look for and analyze similarities and differences within problems or across different problems.It is a skill that helps identify recurring structures, behaviors, or characteristics among objects or concepts. After a problem has been broken down through [**decomposition**](), pattern recognition allows us to observe relationships between its parts.
This skill is essential in problem-solving because it helps identify solutions that can be reused for similar problems, rather than starting from scratch every time.
By recognizing patterns, we can avoid unnecessary duplication and work more efficiently.

# Why It Matters

* It helps reuse existing solutions for similar problems
* It reduces repetitive work and duplication
* It improves efficiency in problem-solving
* It makes complex problems easier to understand by revealing structure

# A Simple Example

Continuing from the car design example:  
- Once you recognize the visual pattern of **one wheel**,  
- it becomes easy to recognize the second wheel—and all the others.  
- You no longer need to analyze each wheel from zero,  
- because you already understand the pattern they follow.
