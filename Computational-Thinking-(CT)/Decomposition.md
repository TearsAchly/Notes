# [Decomposition]() 

**Decomposition** is the practice of breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
Instead of dealing with the whole problem at once, each part is handled individually.
It is commonly used as an early step in **Computational Thinking**, though it does not always have to come first. The goal is clarity—making complexity easier to reason about.
Decomposition is closely related to the idea of **divide and conquer**: solving a big problem by first splitting it into smaller ones.

[**Divide and conquer decomposition**]() is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that solves complex problems by breaking them into smaller, independent subproblems of the same type, solving them recursively, and combining the solutions. It involves three key steps: dividing the problem, conquering (solving) subproblems, and combining results. 

Key Aspects of Divide and Conquer Decomposition

    Process Steps:
        Divide: The problem is split into smaller, manageable subproblems, often recursively.
        Conquer: Subproblems are solved independently, typically using recursion.
        Combine: Solutions to the subproblems are merged to form the solution to the original, larger problem.

# Why It Matters

* Smaller problems are easier to understand and solve
* Work becomes more efficient when tasks are divided within a team
* Debugging and testing become simpler, especially in programming
* Algorithm design becomes clearer and more structured

# A Simple Example

Imagine you want to make **fried rice**. Instead of thinking about the dish as one big task, you break it down:

* What ingredients are needed
* What steps are involved
* In what order those steps should happen

By decomposing the process, cooking becomes more organized and easier to execute.
