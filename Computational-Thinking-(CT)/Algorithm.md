# [Algorithm]()

An **algorithm** is a clear and ordered set of steps or rules designed to solve a problem.
After applying [**decomposition**](), [**abstraction**](), and [**pattern recognition**](), an algorithm brings everything together into a sequence of actions that can be followed consistently to reach a solution. Designing an algorithm means defining a method to solve a problem through a well-structured series of instructions. Each step has a purpose, and the order matters.Algorithm design also includes reviewing and analyzing existing algorithms, then improving them to make solutions more efficient and effective.

# Why It Matters

* It turns ideas and analysis into actionable steps
* It ensures solutions can be repeated and followed consistently
* It helps improve efficiency and clarity in problem-solving
* It allows solutions to be evaluated, tested, and optimized

# Example

Think about making **fried rice**.
The steps must be done in a clear and logical order:

* Prepare the ingredients
* Heat the pan
* Cook the ingredients step by step

If the steps are done out of order, the result will not be the same.
An algorithm works the same way—it requires a structured and consistent sequence.
