This section is divided into two parts:

## 1. Being a Programmer

* how to choose a programming language

## 2. Programming Fundamentals

This part introduces the core building blocks used in most programming languages:

# A Note Before You Continue

Programming is not about typing code as fast as possible. It is about thinking clearly, breaking problems down, and building solutions step by step.
   
Move slowly. Understanding matters more than finishing.
