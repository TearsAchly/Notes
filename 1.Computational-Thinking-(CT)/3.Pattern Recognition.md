## Pattern Recognition

**Pattern Recognition** is the ability to look for and analyze similarities and differences within problems or across different problems.

It is a skill that helps identify recurring structures, behaviors, or characteristics among objects or concepts.<br> After a problem has been broken down through **decomposition**, pattern recognition allows us to observe relationships between its parts.<br>
This skill is essential in problem-solving because it helps identify solutions that can be reused for similar problems, rather than starting from scratch every time.<br>
By recognizing patterns, we can avoid unnecessary duplication and work more efficiently.

## Why It Matters

* It helps reuse existing solutions for similar problems
* It reduces repetitive work and duplication
* It improves efficiency in problem-solving
* It makes complex problems easier to understand by revealing structure

## A Simple Example

Continuing from the car design example:<br>
Once you recognize the visual pattern of **one wheel**,<br>
it becomes easy to recognize the second wheel—and all the others.<br>
You no longer need to analyze each wheel from zero,<br>
because you already understand the pattern they follow.<br>

After understanding the structure and patterns, the final step is turning them into action.
