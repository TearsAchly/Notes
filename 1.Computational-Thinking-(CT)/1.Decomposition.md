## Decomposition

**Decomposition** is the practice of breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
Instead of dealing with the whole problem at once, each part is handled individually.

It is commonly used as an early step in **Computational Thinking**, though it does not always have to come first. The goal is clarity—making complexity easier to reason about.

Decomposition is closely related to the idea of **divide and conquer**: solving a big problem by first splitting it into smaller ones.

## Why It Matters

* Smaller problems are easier to understand and solve
* Work becomes more efficient when tasks are divided within a team
* Debugging and testing become simpler, especially in programming
* Algorithm design becomes clearer and more structured

## A Simple Example

Imagine you want to make **fried rice**.

Instead of thinking about the dish as one big task, you break it down:

* What ingredients are needed
* What steps are involved
* In what order those steps should happen

By decomposing the process, cooking becomes more organized and easier to execute.

Once the problem is broken down, the next step is deciding which parts truly matter.
