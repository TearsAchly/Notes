/*
 * Program Title: Simple Java Program Displaying a Custom Message
 * Author: Achly
 * Date: August 2023
 * Description: This Java program prints a personalized message, "Hello mom," to the console.
 *              It is structured within a basic project layout that includes source and compiled directories.
 *
 * Project Structure:
 * .
 * |-- Main.class     // Compiled bytecode file
 * `-- src
 *     `-- Main.java  // Source code file
 *
 * Logic: The program uses `System.out.println` to display the custom message on the console.
 * Preconditions: None
 * Postconditions: The message "Hello mom" is displayed on the console.
 *
 * Program Flow:
 * 1. The program starts execution from the `main` method, which is the entry point for Java programs.
 * 2. The `System.out.println` method is called to print the message "Hello mom" to the console.
 * 3. The program completes execution after the message is displayed, with no further instructions.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The `Main.java` source file is located in the `src` directory.
 * - After compilation, the generated `Main.class` file is used for execution.
